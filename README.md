How to use it:

* Call, Answer, Reject, Destroy  each other requests

Gotchas:

 * The login is fake, so just write in dummy login and password
 * The tests are absent, cause basically, entire application is browser dependent and the global ``` navigator.getUserMedia ``` is not availble on node

Future plans:

* Add nightwatch (selenium) tests
* Add MongoDB or other database, and do the login part using JWT or sessions
* Try different WebRTC library
* Add support for building and minifying all source code

Libraries, features used:

* React
